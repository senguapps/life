Sengu Life
====

This is something that I've wanted to build for a long time. It's a **timeline of important events** in my life, visualized in a way my mind always imagine it. There was something called [**Lifepath.me**](http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4) but now it's gone. How about Facebook timeline? Meh.

So, this is it. Have a look at 

Features
--------

- Super simple
- No fancy formatting
- No fancy setup
- No fancy effects
- Flexible datetimes because sometimes you don't remember the exact date of an event

Datetime "syntax"
-----------------

- `2000` - event that happen in that year
- `01/2000` - event that happen in that month/year
- `01/01/2000` - event that happen exactly in that day/month/year
- `2001-2005`, `10/2001-02/03/2005` - event that happen within the two dates
- `~2005` - event that happen around the time in that year
- `2005-~` - event that happen from that year and beyond (now).
